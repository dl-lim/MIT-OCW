# Trends of Simulation A (2) and Simulation B (3)
### 1. What happens to the total population before introducing the antibiotic?
In A, where there was a high growth rate, the total bacteria grows logarithmically as density increases.

In B, where the growth rate was lower than the death rate, the total population starts diminishing after the initial growth spurt

### 2. What happens to the resistant bacteria population before introducing the antibiotic?
In A, it made a growth spurt before reducing in numbers relative to the non-resistant bacteria.  
This is largely due to the death probability of resistant bacteria that is 4 times that of non-resistant bacteria

In B, where the overall death rate was higher than the growth rate, it suffered the same fate as the rest of total population, with a similar trend.

### 3. What happens to the total population after introducing the antibiotic?
In both, as soon as the antibiotic is introduced, the total population is reduced to the  
resistant population only. All non-resistant bacteria have been killed instantly.

### 4. What happens to the resistant bacteria population after introducing the antibiotic?
In A, the population density is reduced, thus allowing a higher growth rate than before the antibiotic was administered.

In B, the death rate was higher than the growth rate, so the (resistant) population dwindled to 0.




# Appendix


### Simulation #2
The Total Population Standard Deviation is:  9.646648066153114e-14
The Total Population's 95% Confidence Interval is:  (200.14, 7.56297208386404e-17)

The Resistant Population Standard Deviation is:  9.646648066153114e-14
The Resistant Population's 95% Confidence Interval is:  (200.14, 7.56297208386404e-17)

At Step 299, both the resistant and total populations are the same, and share the same statistics for standard deviation and confidence interval.

### Simulation #3
The Total Population Standard Deviation is:  0.0  
The Total Population's 95% Confidence Interval is:  (0.0, 0.0)

The Resistant Population Standard Deviation is:  0.0  
The Resistant Population's 95% Confidence Interval is:  (0.0, 0.0)

By Step 299, the entire population is extinct.
